# Optimization algorithms in both Rust & Python

## Goal
Implementing various optimization algorithms (or solvers) in both Rust & Python, both as a learning excercise for the algorithms as well as the Rust language.

Currently working on the Simplex implementation, which is supposedly "relatively simple". Long term, I would like to implement a solver which would benefit a lot from parallization, which is Rust's strong suit!

## Simplex
Currently trying to implement the [Simplex algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm).

### Getting started
#### Python
Requirements:
  Python ^3.11

Navigate to the directory, and read the `README.md` file there:
```
cd linear-programming/simplex-solver/python
```
